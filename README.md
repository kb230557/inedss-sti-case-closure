These scripts are designed to be used by local health department case investigators in Illinois. The scripts use the R Selenium package to mimic a case investigator reviewing and closing chlamydia and gonorrhea cases in I-NEDSS. A description of how the script works as well as processing rules for when a case will be automatically closed are detailed in the document "STI Automatic Case Closure Processing Rules". Please note that processing rules differ depending on the length of time a case has been open - in particular, older cases will be closed even if treatment information is missing. An additional script for end-of-year closures is included that applies "old" processing rules to every case.
